<h2>About Navigators</h2>
<p>I've been developing a space simulation game for a while and the game has gone through various iterations since its inception. I keep changing the idea a bit trying to come up with something that I think works and I think I'm settled on an idea I like at the moment. Navigators (formerly known as Space Commanders) is a real time strategy space simulation game where you travel around and try to make it in an imaginary universe. I'm not really ready to release any other information just yet as the concept is still not finalised, but I'm hoping for a few volunteers to test the game for me and I'd like to get together a focus group to see what works and what doesn't. I'm aiming for this to be a very different kind of space game, where the emphasis is more on running your space ship efficiently and having fun, rather than emphasising graphics. In fact, there's not much in terms of graphics, but hopefully when I realise my vision you will see what I mean.<p>

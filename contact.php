<p>If you're interested in getting involved with the development of Navigators, maybe <a href="mailto:mail@jakestanley.co.uk">send me an email</a> or get in touch with me <a href="http://fb.me/madstanners">on Facebook!</a> Getting involved in development can be as simple as just giving me some ideas or tips if you think I could be doing something better differently or you could help me with artwork, design, testing or, well, anything really! I look forward to hearing from people!</p>
